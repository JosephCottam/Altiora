Altiora
=======

### Level 1
* Write lists and dictionaries as embeded languages.
* Alitora transforms those into new lists/dictionaries.
* Read a final list/dictionary to configure your library!


### Level 2: 
Fluent interface builds the initial dictionary...then you 
get rich fluent interfaces...perhaps very macro-like.
